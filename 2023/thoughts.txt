day 2:

why does cpp not have a built in split of a string function?

with github copilot you can focus more on learning the language than learning how to code
although you don't get to practice writing code as much


day3:

im not looking forward to this day. it is always a bad day when you have to work with 2d arrays.

am i going to do this the normal way or the inverse way. do i loop over everything and see if the numbers have a symbol or do i loop over every symbol and see if it has numbers

why does cpp not protect me from invalid lookups in vectors

why cant you just edit a struct in piece. i needed to add a & to my out pointer.
why do i need to think of this and not the compiler or the language

60923894 too low


day 4:

im switching to ts for a quick win. i did not get time to do it in cpp during the day.

921 is too low
42356 too high

i cant trust any thing copilot writes even if i give it testcases
