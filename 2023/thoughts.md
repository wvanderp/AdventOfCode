## day 2

why does cpp not have a built in split of a string function?

with github copilot you can focus more on learning the language than learning how to code
although you don't get to practice writing code as much

## day3

im not looking forward to this day. it is always a bad day when you have to work with 2d arrays.

am i going to do this the normal way or the inverse way. do i loop over everything and see if the numbers have a symbol or do i loop over every symbol and see if it has numbers

why does cpp not protect me from invalid lookups in vectors

why cant you just edit a struct in piece. i needed to add a & to my out pointer.
why do i need to think of this and not the compiler or the language

60923894 too low

## day 4

im switching to ts for a quick win. i did not get time to do it in cpp during the day.

921 is too low
42356 too high

i cant trust any thing copilot writes even if i give it test cases

## day5

god dam this will be a rough ride

who puts the destination first and then the source?????

part two
15880237 too high witch is a real bitch because it takes forever to calculate

rewriting the ts to cpp is quick with chatgpt but it is unknown if the output is correct.

ive already needed to correct it on a forgotten import and in not able to contain the numbers

ive already give up one. gone to the reddit for inspiration found some and then that did not work and now im reworking the whole code

It was a GOD DAM OFF BY ONE ERROR

right awnser 15880236

id don't know what trigger this for me but I just did it. and it worked so it is not stupid.

Day 5 got me feeling like

It got me feeling like Call_an_ambulance_its_for_me.jpeg

it took me only from 1900 in the mcdonalds till 23:40 at home to solve it

## day 6

I was a bit "inspired" (read spoiled) by the subreddit to use the quadratic equation

so is dusted off my math skills and looked up how to make a quadratic equation. one wolfram alpha query later and i had the formula

the for i believe the first time during advent of code i used calc (aka excel) to calculate the quadratic equation.

so let see if part to is as easy as part one

formula:

```latex
y = -x^2 + bx
```

where b is the time in the race

b = 59688274

distance to beat is 543102016641022

so the cross over points are calculated with

```latex
-x^2 + 59688274x = 543102016641022
```

x≈1.120089434659479898770709×10^7 ≈ 11200894.34659479898770709  ≈ 11200895 (rounded up)
x≈4.848737965340520101229291×10^7 ≈ 48487379.65340520101229291 ≈ 48487378 (rounded up)

so the answer in between these two points

```latex
    48487378-11200895 = 37286485
```

37286486 too high
37286484 too low
37286485 just right

these calculation have been ajusted to make it seam like i had the answer first try.
