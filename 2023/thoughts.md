## day 2

why does cpp not have a built in split of a string function?

with github copilot you can focus more on learning the language than learning how to code
although you don't get to practice writing code as much

## day3

im not looking forward to this day. it is always a bad day when you have to work with 2d arrays.

am i going to do this the normal way or the inverse way. do i loop over everything and see if the numbers have a symbol or do i loop over every symbol and see if it has numbers

why does cpp not protect me from invalid lookups in vectors

why cant you just edit a struct in piece. i needed to add a & to my out pointer.
why do i need to think of this and not the compiler or the language

60923894 too low

## day 4

im switching to ts for a quick win. i did not get time to do it in cpp during the day.

921 is too low
42356 too high

i cant trust any thing copilot writes even if i give it test cases

## day5

god dam this will be a rough ride

who puts the destination first and then the source?????

part two
15880237 too high witch is a real bitch because it takes forever to calculate

rewriting the ts to cpp is quick with chatgpt but it is unknown if the output is correct.

ive already needed to correct it on a forgotten import and in not able to contain the numbers

ive already give up one. gone to the reddit for inspiration found some and then that did not work and now im reworking the whole code

It was a GOD DAM OFF BY ONE ERROR

right awnser 15880236

id don't know what trigger this for me but I just did it. and it worked so it is not stupid.

Day 5 got me feeling like
